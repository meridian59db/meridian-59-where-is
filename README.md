## Why a tool for this particular idea
The urge of having an app for this, **came by my interest for Inky Caps, as an Inky Cap addicted**, I felt the needing of implementing some kind of way for the people to tell others where they had found the wanderer npcs from Meridian 59, in a more fancy way instead chatting, because why not, eh? Also the main fact is that I wanted to learn more about crafting apps connected to **Google Firebase** thats why I connected the loving for the game with the main pain I felt the game had, cause recently I've been noticing people were always asking for Miriana, or Izzio...

## Credits
- The Brazilian Boys for supporting me trough Discord
- JRGomes for helping me with many tips and straightforward teaching about Google Firebase and etc...

Please don't say this is useless, I spend more than 12 hours for this, and I made with from the bottom of my heart, for you Meridian 59 community.
